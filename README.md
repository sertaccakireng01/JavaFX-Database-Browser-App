Database Browser Application (JavaFX & JDBC)

This application is a comprehensive database management tool developed as the final project for my Advanced Java Programming course. 
It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with databases, allowing for seamless data manipulation and query execution, and earned a 90% score.

Key Features:

Dynamic Table Browsing: Automatically lists all tables in the connected database and displays their content upon selection.

Full CRUD Operations: Specialized interfaces to Add, Update, and Delete records directly through the GUI.

Custom SQL Execution: Includes a dedicated "Custom Query" section where users can write and execute their own SQL commands.

Real-time Data Updates: The UI reflects changes immediately after database operations are performed.

Technical Highlights:

JDBC Integration: Established a solid connection between the JavaFX frontend and the backend database for reliable data persistence.

MVC Architecture: Followed the Model-View-Controller pattern to ensure clean code separation and maintainability.

Responsive GUI: Designed with JavaFX to handle window resizing and dynamic component updates.

Exception Handling: Implemented strict error management for SQL syntax errors, connection timeouts, and invalid data inputs.

As a milestone of the course, this project integrated everything from GUI design to complex backend logic. 
Translating the functional wireframes into a working database browser required deep knowledge of event handling and relational database management. 
It was an excellent exercise in building a tool that solves real-world data management challenges.
